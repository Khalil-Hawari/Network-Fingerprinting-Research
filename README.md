# Network-Fingerprinting-Research
ETC is the name of the game - "Encrypted Traffic Classification".
This repository is used for experiments that evaluate different Machine Learning algorithms' effectiveness at classifying Encrypted Network Traffic.
These models are determining what App (website, e.g. "Youtube.com"), or what Category (type of activity, e.g. "Instant Messaging") the traffic flow represents. 

While most of the code is not currently publicly available in this repo, feel free to send your inquiries about this research to Khalil Hawari at khalilhawari17@gmail.com
